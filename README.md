- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @songwriterpdx.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in both the creative and technical aspects of music composition.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently participating in a group called MEW (Music Every Week) that has helped me write lots of songs, but I've had a learning curve with DAW systems and recording technology. Music software developers are my heroes.
- ðŸ“« I've posted some originals on [Soundcloud] (https://soundcloud.com/j-brandlon).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can sing the Drupal theme song.
